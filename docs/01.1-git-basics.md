# Command Line and Git Basics

## 1. Moving Around with `cd`

Before using Git, you need to navigate to the correct folder.  
The `cd` command means "change directory".

### Common Uses

- Go inside a folder:
  ```bash
  cd folder_name
  ```

- Go back one folder:
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

- Go to your home directory:
  ```bash
  cd ~
  ```

- Go to a specific path:
  ```bash
  cd /Users/yourname/Desktop/my_project
  ```

Use `ls` (on macOS/Linux) or `dir` (on Windows) to see what is inside your current directory.

## 2. Checking Git Installation

Before using Git commands, make sure Git is installed.

```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number such as `git version 2.39.3`, Git is ready to use.

## 3. Common Git Commands

### a. `git clone`

Downloads a remote repository (for example, from GitHub) onto your local computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

This creates a folder with a complete copy of the project.

---

### b. `git init`

Creates a new Git repository in the current folder.

```bash
git init
```

Run this inside an existing folder to start tracking its files with Git.

---

### c. `git remote add`

Links your local repository to a remote repository (for example, a GitHub repository).  
This is usually done after running `git init`.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
```

Here:
- `origin` is the default name given to the remote repository.
- The URL is the location of your remote repository.

You can check your remote setup with:
```bash
git remote -v
```

---

### d. `git status`

Shows the current state of your repository.  
It tells you which files are new, modified, or ready to commit.

```bash
git status
```

Example output:

```
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified: index.html
Untracked files:
  newfile.txt
```

---

### e. `git add`

Adds files to the staging area, preparing them for commit.

Add one file:
```bash
git add filename
```

Add all changes:
```bash
git add .
```

---

### f. `git commit`

Saves your staged changes with a descriptive message.

```bash
git commit -m "Added homepage and updated styles"
```

The message should briefly describe what was changed.

---

### g. `git push`

Uploads your local commits to a remote repository such as GitHub.

```bash
git push origin main
```

or just

```bash
git push
```

`origin` is the default name for the remote, and `main` is the branch name.

---

## 4. Example Workflow

```bash
cd my_project
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
git push origin main
```
